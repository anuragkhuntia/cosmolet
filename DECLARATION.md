# Declaration: AI-Assisted Development

## üöÄ About This Project
This project extensively utilizes AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to assist in code generation and problem solving. 

As a result:
- The code may contain bugs, inefficiencies, or unconventional approaches
- Some implementations may not follow best practices
- The architecture may evolve rapidly as the project matures

## üôè My Request to You
Please:
1. **Focus on the vision** - Judge the project by its ideas and potential rather than code quality
2. **Embrace the experiment** - This is an exploration of AI-assisted development
3. **Contribute your expertise** - If you see problems, consider helping improve them

## ü§ù Call to Action for Developers
This is an open source project and I actively welcome:
- Bug reports with constructive feedback
- Pull requests to improve implementations
- Architectural suggestions
- Documentation improvements
- Feature proposals

Let's build something remarkable together - where human creativity meets AI capabilities!
